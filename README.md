# jTabRF - Guitar Chord and Tab Library

This is a fork of the jTab Javascript library (See [jTab](http://jtab.tardate.com/) for more info).
RF stands for refactor. For the record: the original library is aussumn! While fixing a bug I noticed that 
there's some range for refactoring and testing this library and improving the code quality.
This is the place to go for radical changes that make reading and maintining the code easier.
